<p>During the COVID pandemic, universal testing had once been a topic in Hong Kong. Even if we can handle millions of testings a day, is it a good approach?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume 99.9% accurate for positive and 99% for negative and 80,000 people are infected.</p>

<p>We will find 7,920,000 x 0.001 + 80,000 x 0.99 = 87,120 people infected. But among them, only 1 - (80,000 x 0.99/87,120) = 9.1% are not infected. They are false positive cases. While 1%, 800 infected people will test negative! Given that the figures I used were almost ideal!</p>
<p>As a result, universal testing is pointless. It will find many false positive cases, while hundreds false negative cases will be missed.</p>
<p>So what are the right moves? Here are my suggestions.</p>
<ol>
<li>We test all patients who thought they have got the virus, even with very mild symptoms. So we can detect the newly infected cases and isolate them as soon as possible.</li>
<li>We test the correlations of the confirm cases sooner the better, obviously they are more likely to be infected than any others.</li>
<li>We keep testing high risk population. Such as staff in hospitals, nurses, doctors, etc. If they have got the virus, they will infect the most vulnerable people.</li>
<li>Start random testings. Let&rsquo;s test 500 people randomly, from all walks of life. It will give us a basic idea how the virus spreads in the community. We can do this on monthly basis.</li>
</ol>
