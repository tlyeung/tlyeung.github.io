<p>For our honeymoon trip, my wife and I visited Cebu, where we earned our first diving certificate and had an amazing experience exploring the underwater world. We were also impressed by the beautiful sights on land.</p>
<h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>
<p>Transportation in Cebu can be difficult, as Cebu City is often congested and lacks traffic lights in the other areas, making it dangerous for drivers and pedestrians. Some tourists choose to rent electric motorcycles, which are affordable and convenient. However, roads can be bumpy and prone to flooding during heavy rain.</p>
<p>Tuk-tuks in Bohol are a more affordable option, costing about half the price of a car. It is recommended to check with hotels or apps for transportation options and prices.</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>Rice is a staple food in the local cuisine. Seafood and fruits both are fresh and flavorful. We have also tried roast chicken and roast pork, they are tasty but a bit too salty. San Miguel beer and soda are cheap and readily available.</p>
<h2 id="attractions">Attractions</h2>
<p>Moalboal is a popular destination for diving due to its many diving spots. However, there are few good hotel options available in the area.</p>
<p>In Oslob, the whale shark feeding has become a popular check-in spot, but there isn&rsquo;t much else to see.</p>
<p>Snorkeling in Balicasag may not be worth the time, as there are better diving spots available. It is a slightly disappointing island.</p>
<p>Panglao in Bohol has many diving spots. Other attractions that can be visited for a day. The hotel tourism area can be crowded with many tourists.</p>
<p>While there aren&rsquo;t many must-see landmarks on Bohol, the tarsiers are a unique and worthwhile attraction to visit. However, the information provided at these spots is often limited. For example there are little mention of conservation efforts or the knowledge about the tarsiers in the Sanctuary. I don&rsquo;t even know how do the tarsiers sound like after the visit. Or in Chocolate hills, no information provided there about how the unique local geography was formed.</p>
<p>Cebu City do not have many tourist attractions, but there are some large malls for visitors to shop.</p>
<p>One noteworthy aspect of Cebu and Bohol is the prevalence of buildings constructed using coral stones. Several prominent landmarks such as Fort San Pedro in Cebu City, Baclayon Church in Bohol, Cuartel and Baluarte Ruins in Oslob, are constructed using these unique materials. These structures not only impress with their grand size, but also feature the intricate details of the coral fossils visible on the surface. It&rsquo;s a fascinating glimpse into the history and culture of the region and a must-see for visitors interested in architecture and history.</p>
<p>Overall, many of the popular tourist spots are one-sided check-in spots, meaning they are designed for photo opportunities rather than for a meaningful cultural experience. You have to do your homework before.</p>
